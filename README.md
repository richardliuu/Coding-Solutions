# solutions

This repository contains my Python solutions to programming problems that I have done. It serves as a record of my progress and a place to share solutions if others are stuck. The repository is organized into a structure of folders, labeled by specific contests and years like the CCC. In these folders are files that contain the solutions to the problems labeled by name.
